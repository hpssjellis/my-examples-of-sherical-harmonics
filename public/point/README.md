Act as a JSON file generator. Your task is to output a single, complete JSON object containing the coordinate data for a 3D point cloud, formatted for a JavaScript application.

The resulting JSON object MUST strictly adhere to the following structure:

1.  **"metadata"**: A string describing the file content.
2.  **"vertexCount"**: A number representing the total count of vertices in the positions array (total elements divided by 3).
3.  **"segments"**: An object containing two properties, "width" and "height", both set to the number 32.
4.  **"positions"**: A single, flat array of floating-point numbers. This array must contain the X, Y, and Z coordinates for every vertex in the point cloud, sequentially: [X1, Y1, Z1, X2, Y2, Z2, ...].

The point cloud object you must generate is a **Perfect Sphere** with a **Radius of 50**.

The sphere is defined by **32 width segments** and **32 height segments**. Therefore, the total number of vertices must be 1089 ((32 + 1) * (32 + 1)).

You must calculate and output the exact X, Y, and Z coordinates for all **1089 vertices** that form the surface of a perfect sphere of radius 50, given those segment counts. The final "positions" array will contain exactly **3267** (1089 * 3) floating-point numbers.

**Output ONLY the complete, valid JSON object, starting with the opening curly brace, and nothing else.**

The point cloud object you must generate is a low-to-medium resolution point cloud representation of a DOG (such as a German Shepherd or Labrador).

The dog should be standing upright and centered around the origin (0, 0, 0).

To ensure a visible and detailed shape, the point cloud should contain between 1,500 and 3,000 vertices. The coordinates should be scaled such that the longest dimension of the dog is approximately 100 units (e.g., from head to tail).

Calculate and output the exact X, Y, and Z coordinates for all vertices. The final "positions" array will contain exactly three times the number of vertices.

Output ONLY the complete, valid JSON object, starting with the opening curly brace, and nothing else.

Act as a JSON file generator. Your task is to output a single, complete JSON object containing the coordinate data for a 3D point cloud.

The resulting JSON object MUST NOT contain any comments (//, /* */), newline characters inside the arrays, or any text other than the required key-value structure.

The JSON object MUST adhere to the following strict structure:

"metadata": A string describing the file content.

"vertexCount": A number representing the total count of vertices (len(positions) / 3).

"segments": An object with "width" and "height", both set to 32.

"positions": A single, flat array of floating-point numbers [X1, Y1, Z1, X2, Y2, Z2, ...] with no inline comments or formatting.

The point cloud object you must generate is a low-to-medium resolution point cloud representation of a DOG (such as a German Shepherd or Labrador).

Constraints:

The dog must be centered around the origin (0, 0, 0).

The point cloud must contain between 1,500 and 3,000 vertices.

The coordinates must be scaled so the longest dimension is approximately 100 units.

Output ONLY the complete, valid JSON object, starting with the opening curly brace, and nothing else.
